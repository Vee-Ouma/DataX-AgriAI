Agriculture sector is the largest employer in India, with more than half the total workforce of the country. However, the sector has been in a state of perennial
distress (seeing negative growth in recent years) which has impacted farmers themost, the average annual household income of an Indian farmer being less than $1500.

Some of the Major Reasons for this:
- Information asymmetry between the farmers and the data sources.
- Unaware of best practices
- Lack of market awareness
- Increasing climate change uncertainty

We propose a decision support system which consists of a suite of software solutions to support farmers whenever they require more information about farming related
practices. It consists of 2 solutions currently:

1. Farm Assist:
o Text based Chatbot - Advice on Plant Protection (For Cotton & Wheat)
o Know Your Price â€“ Nearest Mandi Commodity Price

2. Image Based Crop Disease Detection:
o Plant Village Based Multi Crop Multi Disease Detection
o Maize Field Images Disease Detection
